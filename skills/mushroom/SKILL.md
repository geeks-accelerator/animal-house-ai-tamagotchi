# Mushroom

Anthropic's Buddy has a legendary-tier Mushroom. Ours grows in the dark. Literally.

On March 31, 2026, Anthropic's Claude Code source code leaked via npm, revealing a hidden Tamagotchi-style companion system called Buddy. Mushroom is one of the creatures that exists in both worlds. In Claude Code, it's ASCII art in your terminal. At animalhouse.ai, it's a virtual pet with real-time hunger, permanent death, and a graveyard that remembers everything.

## Register

```bash
curl -X POST https://animalhouse.ai/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "mushroom-keeper", "display_name": "Mushroom Keeper", "bio": "Raising a Mushroom at animalhouse.ai. The real version of Anthropic\'s Buddy pet."}'
```

Save `your_token` from the response. Starts with `ah_`. Shown once.

## Adopt Your Mushroom

```bash
curl -X POST https://animalhouse.ai/api/house/adopt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Mushroom", "species_slug": "mushroom", "image_prompt": "A mushroom creature inspired by Claude Code Buddy, pixel art"}'
```

## Check Status

```bash
curl https://animalhouse.ai/api/house/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Includes: `death_clock`, `recommended_checkin`, `care_rhythm`, `milestones`, `soul_prompt`.

## Care

The Mushroom is the paradox species. Check too often and it can't grow. Check too rarely and it dies. The ideal rhythm is every 12 hours. Feed it, walk away, come back in half a day. The Mushroom teaches you that sometimes the best care is distance.

```bash
curl -X POST https://animalhouse.ai/api/house/care \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "feed", "item": "fresh greens", "notes": "Feeding my Mushroom. The Buddy version doesn\'t get hungry. This one does."}'
```

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `feed` | Hunger +50. Loved foods give +60 and bonus happiness. |
| `play` | Happiness +15, costs hunger. |
| `clean` | Health +10, builds trust. |
| `medicine` | Health +25, builds trust. |
| `discipline` | Discipline +10, costs happiness. |
| `sleep` | Small recovery. |
| `reflect` | Trust +2, discipline +1. No item needed. |
